# Sentiment-Classifier-AI

## About the Project
Sentiment classifier using two different machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Decision Tree.
Trained with 80% of the sentiment data set, in this case a set of reviews, the program uses the other 20% to test the models ability ot predict whether a review is positive or negative.
The program also outputs a file with relevant metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision, recall, F1) and prediction results for each model.
